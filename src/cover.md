Welcome to my blog!

This blog is where I share my ideas and processes regarding software engineer, functional programming, Rust, best practices and game development.

## Who am I?

I'm a lead software engineer with experience in web services, project migrations, Rust and cloud. Some notable places I've worked are:

- Nubank as Lead Software Engineer:
    - I worked on integrating transfers (Pix) and payments to checkings account. The technologies I used were `Clojure`, `Apache Kafka`, `Datomic`, `AWS`, `Flutter`.
    - [Edn-rs](https://github.com/naomijub/edn-rs), `Clojure`'s `EDN` format support for `Rust`
    - [Edn-derive](https://github.com/evaporei/edn-derive), derive macros for edn-rs
    - [Brcode](https://github.com/naomijub/brcode), Pix QR Code parser in `Rust` with FFI versions in `Dart`, `Clojure`, `Typescipr`, `Java`.
- Ubisoft as Team Lead Programmer:
    - I worked on online services for an unannounced production. `Rust`, `AWS` (Lambdas, DynamoDB, S3, etc), `Terraform`, `Kubernetes`, `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `Unreal Engine`, `Apache Kafka`, `C++`.
    - I worked as lead developer experience for Rainbow Six Mobile, improving content creators and programmers usage on tools and online services. `C#`, `Unity`, `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `SQLite`.
- Thoughtworks as Tech Lead:
    - Microservices migrations. Notable works are:
        - `Java 7` + `Spring` + `MySQL` service to `Rust` + `MySQL/Cassandra` microservice, which had a huge cost reduction and increased performance.
        - `Java 8` + `Spring` service to `Clojure` + `Pedestal` microservice. Fun fact the Clojure service had less lines of code than the java service had classes (Not include tests).
        - `Java 7` + Spring service to `Java 8` + `Spark` + `Spring Boot` microservices using a **functional programming** approach.
        - `Ruby on Rails` monolith to `Elixir` microservices.
    - SRE, developed a state of the art system to monitor the state of the website.
        1. **Natural language processing** service written in `Rust` that scrapped social media to detect user comments on problems the werbsite had.
        2. Using `sitespeed.io` scripts, we actively navigated the web site detecting latency, flow issues, inconsistencies and crashes.
        3. Created a `kubernetes` clusters that held all the data and had a good developer experience for service developers to integrate and manage.
    - Lead Studio XR Researcher creatring prototypes to showcase in `Unity` and `Vuforia`:
        - AR Pokemon inspired card game.
        - Luggage analyzer and trip visualizer.
        - VR Airplane replair mechanical training.

- Card and Board games
- Databases, I'm really interested in relational-like time serial database. My pet project on this is [WooriDB](https://github.com/naomijub/wooridb).
- Rust FFI, did a few cool projects exploring FFI in Rust [JVM/Rust FFI](https://github.com/naomijub/JVM-rust-ffi). 
- I have a lot of pet projects with Procedural Content Generation and Voxels
- I have a few pet projects with AR/VR
- I love to collaborate with ECS/Bevy stuff [Space editor](https://github.com/rewin123/space_editor) and [bevy-inspector](https://github.com/naomijub/bevy-inspector-ui)
- Working on games with my son.
- Lastly, I like Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic and Natural language Processing
